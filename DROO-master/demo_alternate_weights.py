#  This file contains a demo evaluating the performance of DROO with laternating-weight WDs. It loads the training samples with default WDs' weights from ./data/data_10.mat and with alternated weights from ./data/data_10_WeightsAlternated.mat. The channel gains in both files are the same. However, the optimal offloading mode, resource allocation, and the maximum computation rate in 'data_10_WeightsAlternated.mat' are recalculated since WDs' weights are alternated.
